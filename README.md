# Files and Folders Tree Builder

Simple tool (with sources), written in Delphi tool to build entire tree of your folders and subfolders.

### Status

Last time `.dpr` file was saved in Delphi: **16 November 2007**. Last time `.exe` file was built: **12 December 2008**.

**This project ABANDONED! There is no wiki, issues and no support. There will be no future updates. Unfortunately, you're on your own.**

I don't have access to either most of my components used in this or any other of my Delphi projects, nor to Delphi itself. Even translation of this project to English was done by text-editing all `.dfm` and `.pas` files and therefore it may be cracked. It was made in hope to be usefull to anyone and for the same reason I'm releasing its source code, but you're using this project or source code completely at your own responsibility, without any implied usefulness.

### To-do list

- works only in Windows with Polish language, because assumes, that roo folder is called +_Mój komputer_", which is incorrect on non-Polish Windows systems,

- function keys (`Run`, `Rename`, `Delete`, `Open` and `Explore`) does not work, if selected folder contains square (`[]`) or normal (`()`) brackets in its name,

- above mentioned function keys works only on files in listed folders; worth implementing for entire folders as well?
